## Friends of friends
```
We can create a dictionary mapping people to sets of their friends. For example, we might say:

d["fred"]  = set(["wilma", "betty", "barney", "bam-bam"])  
d["wilma"] = set(["fred", "betty", "dino"])

With this in mind, write a function friend_of_friends that takes such a dictionary mapping
of people to sets of friends and returns a new dictionary mapping all the same people to sets of their friends of friends.
```

```
For example, since wilma is a friend of fred, and dino is a friend of wilma, 

dino is a friend-of-friend of fred.

This set should exclude any direct friends, so even though betty is also a friend of wilma, betty does not count as a friend-of-friend of fred (since she is simply a friend of fred).

Thus, in this example, fred’s ‘friends-of-friends’ is a set containing just dino and 
wilma’s ‘friends-of-friends’ is a set containing both barney and bam-bam.

Also, do not include anyone either in their own set of friends or their own 
set of friends-of-friends. 

You may assume that everyone listed in any of the friend sets also is included 
as a key in the dictionary.

## source code

```
def friend_of_friends(d):
    ff = {}
    for person in d:
        friends = d[person]
        # set comprehension makes it possible to
        # reduce the code to one line
        ff[person] = {
            fof
            for f in friends
            for fof in d[f].difference(friends)
            if fof is not person
        }

    return ff
```
