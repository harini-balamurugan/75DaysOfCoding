## Second Biggest Value
```
Write a function second_biggest_value which accepts three integers, and does the following:
returns the second biggest value among the three
returns “NA” if there are two or more equal values

Come up with a solution which does not use sorting!
```

## Example

```
(1, 2, 3) -> 2
(3, 1, -1) -> 1
(3, 5, -1) -> 3
(3, -1, -1) -> "NA"
```

## source code

```
def second_biggest_value(a,b,c):
  if((a > b and a < c) or (a > c and a < b)):
    return a
  elif((b > c and b < a) or (b > a and b < c)):
    return b
  elif((c > b and c < a) or (c > a and c < b)):
    return c
  else:
    return 'NA'
```
